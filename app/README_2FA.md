How to run through 2fa.js:


1) Run/Debug 2fa.js in your IDE (in VSCode the "console" setting must be set to "externalTerminal" in the launch configuration to allow inputs).
2) Copy the link displayed in the console and paste it into your Internet browser.
3) The browser will display a QR code. Scan it using your mobile phone (make sure you have an authenticator app installed).
4) The app will show a code that changes every 30 seconds. Type that code into the console.
5) The verification result will display. You can continue to test codes against it or close the console.
